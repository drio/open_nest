I am exited to report that I found the perfect project to help me transition
to a more lower level toolchain: [arduino-mk](https://github.com/sudar/Arduino-Makefile).

It is a make file that provides different targets to complete the arduino common
tasks: compile your code, send it to the arduino and more (like connecting to the
serial console).

But the most significant feature for me is being able to separate my code in multiple
files and directory so I can have a nice structure. Take a look to my
src structure [now](https://github.com/drio/open_nest/tree/master/src/open_nest).
Much better eh?
